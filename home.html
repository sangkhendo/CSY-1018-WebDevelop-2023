                    My name is Sangkhendo Lama and I am a 22-year-old student,
                    currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree at Nami College.<br>
                    I have always been passionate about designing and <br>
                    it has been my dream to pursue a career in this field.<br>
                    Looking towards the future, I am excited to see where my passion for designing takes me. <br>
                    I hope to work for a renowned design firm and eventually start my own design company. <br>
                    I know it will take a lot of hard work and dedication, but I am ready to put in the effort to make my dreams
                    a reality.
